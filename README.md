‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Usage
To run this application on your local machine, please follow these steps:
1. Clone the Repository
code
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-yield-prediction.git
cd crop-yield-prediction
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
For macOS/Linux:
code
Bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
For Windows:
code
Bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
Create a file named requirements.txt and add the following libraries to it:
code
Code
streamlit
pandas
scikit-learn==<your_sklearn_version> # e.g., 1.3.0
joblib
Then, install them using pip:
code
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt```

**4. Run the Streamlit App**

Make sure your trained model file (`crop_yield_model.pkl`) is in the same directory as the app script.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
Your web browser will automatically open with the application running!
üî¨ Project Methodology
The prediction model was developed following a standard machine learning workflow:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The dataset was analyzed to understand feature distributions and correlations. Key insights included the strong positive correlation between Rainfall_mm and Yield, and the approximately normal distribution of the crop yield.
Data Preprocessing: Categorical features (Region, Soil_Type, etc.) were converted into a numerical format using One-Hot Encoding. Boolean features were converted to integers (0/1).
Model Training: A Random Forest Regressor was chosen for its high accuracy on tabular data and its ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships. The model was trained on 80% of the dataset.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance was validated on a 20% hold-out test set to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen data.
üìä Model Performance
The final model achieved the following performance on the test set:
R-squared (R¬≤): 0.91
(This means the model can explain 91% of the variance in crop yield.)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.41 tons/hectare
(On average, the model's prediction is off by only 0.41 tons per hectare.)
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.27
üöÄ Future Improvements
Optimization Mode: Add a feature to find the optimal crop type and conditions for a user's specific, unchangeable inputs (like Region and Soil Type).
Prediction Explanation: Integrate SHAP or LIME to explain why the model made a particular prediction, increasing trust and transparency.
Deployment: Deploy the application to a cloud service (like Streamlit Community Cloud or Heroku) to make it publicly accessible.
